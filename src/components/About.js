      <h3>About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I'm a data specialist with a background in information systems and a
        passion for solving business challenges through machine learning,
        analytics, and clear communication. My portfolio site reflects this
        mindset — designed with a modern, analytics-themed interface, it
        showcases my technical skills in Python, SQL, Scikit-learn, Tableau,
        Power BI, Git, AWS, Docker, TensorFlow, and Excel. The site features
        dynamic visual elements like line and bar graphs to highlight my
        data-driven approach, along with a clean contact form for direct
        outreach and a downloadable resume option that streamlines professional
        engagement. From design to deployment, the site is a testament to my
        ability to turn data and design into impact.
